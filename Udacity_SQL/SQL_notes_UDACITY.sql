### LIMIT

/*
1. Try using LIMIT yourself below by writing a query 
that displays all the data in the occurred_at, 
account_id, and channel columns of the web_events table, 
and limits the output to only the first 15 rows.
*/

SELECT occurred_at, account_id, channel 
FROM web_events
LIMIT(15); # LIMIT 15




### ORDER BY

/*
1. Write a query to return the 10 earliest orders in 
the orders table. Include the id, occurred_at, and 
total_amt_usd.
*/

SELECT id, occurred_at, total_amt_usd 
FROM orders
ORDER BY occurred_at # ORDER BY 2
LIMIT(10); # LIMIT 10


/*
2. Write a query to return the top 5 orders in terms of 
largest total_amt_usd. Include the id, account_id, and 
total_amt_usd.
*/

SELECT id, account_id, total_amt_usd
FROM orders
ORDER BY total_amt_usd DESC # ORDER BY 3 DESC
LIMIT(5); # LIMIT 5


/*
3. Write a query to return the lowest 20 orders in 
terms of smallest total_amt_usd. Include the id, 
account_id, and total_amt_usd.
*/

SELECT id, account_id, total_amt_usd
FROM orders
ORDER BY total_amt_usd # ORDER BY 3
LIMIT(20); # LIMIT 20




### ORDER BY RETURNS

/*
1. Write a query that displays the order ID, account 
ID, and total dollar amount for all the orders, sorted 
first by the account ID (in ascending order), and then 
by the total dollar amount (in descending order).
*/

SELECT id, account_id, total_amt_usd
FROM orders
ORDER BY account_id, 
total_amt_usd DESC; # ORDER BY 2, 3 DESC


/*
2. Now write a query that again displays order ID, 
account ID, and total dollar amount for each order, but 
this time sorted first by total dollar amount (in 
descending order), and then by account ID (in 
ascending order).
*/

SELECT id, account_id, total_amt_usd
FROM orders
ORDER BY total_amt_usd DESC, 
account_id; # ORDER BY 3 DESC, 2


/*
3. Compare the results of these two queries above. How 
are the results different when you switch the column 
you sort on first?
*/

/*
In query #1, all of the orders for each account ID are 
grouped together, and then within each of those 
groupings, the orders appear from the greatest order 
mount to the least. In query #2, since you sorted by 
the total dollar amount first, the orders appear from 
greatest to least regardless of which account ID hey 
were from. Then they are sorted by account ID next. 
(The secondary sorting by account ID is difficult to 
see here, since only if there were two orders with 
equal total dollar amounts would there need to be any 
sorting by account ID.)
*/




### WHERE


/*
1. Pulls the first 5 rows and all columns from the 
orders table that have a dollar amount of gloss_amt_usd 
greater than or equal to 1000.
*/

SELECT * 
FROM orders
WHERE gloss_amt_usd >= 1000
LIMIT(5); # LIMIT 5


/*
2. Pulls the first 10 rows and all columns from the 
orders table that have a total_amt_usd less than 500.
*/

SELECT *
FROM orders
WHERE total_amt_usd < 500
LIMIT(10); # LIMIT 10




### Practice Question Using WHERE with Non-Numeric Data


/*
1. Filter the accounts table to include the company 
name, website, and the primary point of contact 
(primary_poc) just for the Exxon Mobil company in the 
accounts table.
*/

SELECT name, website, primary_poc
FROM accounts
WHERE name = 'Exxon Mobil'; 
# WHERE name IN('Exxon Mobil')




### Questions using Arithmetic Operations


/*
1. Create a column that divides the standard_amt_usd by 
the standard_qty to find the unit price for standard 
paper for each order. Limit the results to the first 10 
orders, and include the id and account_id fields.
*/

SELECT id, account_id, standard_amt_usd/standard_qty 
AS unit_price
FROM orders
LIMIT(10); # LIMIT 10


SELECT id, account_id, 
round(standard_amt_usd/standard_qty, 2) AS unit_price
FROM orders
LIMIT(10); # LIMIT 10


/*
2. Write a query that finds the percentage of revenue 
that comes from poster paper for each order. You will 
need to use only the columns that end with _usd. (Try 
to do this without using the total column.) Display 
the id and account_id fields also. NOTE - you will 
receive an error with the correct solution to this 
question. This occurs because at least one of the 
values in the data creates a division by zero in your 
formula. You will learn later in the course how to 
fully handle this issue. For now, you can just limit 
your calculations to the first 10 orders, as we did 
in question #1, and you'll avoid that set of data that
causes the problem.
*/

SELECT id, account_id, (poster_amt_usd * 100)/(poster_amt_usd + standard_amt_usd + 
	gloss_amt_usd) AS percentage_revenue_poster
FROM orders;


SELECT id, account_id, round((poster_amt_usd * 100)/(poster_amt_usd + standard_amt_usd + 
	gloss_amt_usd + 0.0000001), 2) AS percentage_revenue_poster
FROM orders;

sales_rep_id for Walmart, Target, and Nordstrom.
*/

SELECT name, primary_poc, sales_rep_id

/*
2. Use the web_events table to find all information regarding individuals who 
were contacted via the channel of organic or adwords.

### Questions using AND and BETWEEN operators


/*
1. Write a query that returns all the orders where the standard_qty is over 
1000, the poster_qty is 0, and the gloss_qty is 0.
*/

SELECT *
FROM orders
WHERE standard_qty > 1000 AND poster_qty = 0 AND gloss_qty = 0;


/*
2. Using the accounts table, find all the companies whose names do not start 
with 'C' and end with 's'.
*/

SELECT *
FROM accounts
WHERE (name NOT LIKE 'C%') AND (name NOT LIKE '%s');


/*
3. When you use the BETWEEN operator in SQL, do the results include the values 
of your endpoints, or not? Figure out the answer to this important question by 
writing a query that displays the order date and gloss_qty data for all orders 
where gloss_qty is between 24 and 29. Then look at your output to see if the 
BETWEEN operator included the begin and end values or not.
*/

SELECT occurred_at, gloss_qty
FROM orders
WHERE gloss_qty BETWEEN 24 AND 29
ORDER BY gloss_qty DESC; # ORDER BY 2 DESC


/*
4. Use the web_events table to find all information regarding individuals who

### DATE FUNCTIONS


/*
GROUPing BY a date column is not usually very useful in 
SQL, as these columns tend to have transaction data 
down to a second. Keeping date information at such a 
granular data is both a blessing and a curse, as it 
gives really precise information (a blessing), but it 
makes grouping information together directly difficult 
(a curse).

Lucky for us, there are a number of built in SQL 
functions that are aimed at helping us improve our 
experience in working with dates.

The first function you are introduced to in working 
with dates is DATE_TRUNC.

DATE_TRUNC allows you to truncate your date to a 
particular part of your date-time column. Common 
trunctions are day, month, and year. Here is a great 
blog post by Mode Analytics on the power of this 
function.

DATE_PART can be useful for pulling a specific portion 
of a date, but notice pulling month or day of the week 
(dow) means that you are no longer keeping the years 
in order. Rather you are grouping for certain 
components regardless of which year they belonged in.

For additional functions you can use with dates, check 
out the documentation here, but the DATE_TRUNC and 
DATE_PART functions definitely give you a great start!
*/


/*
1. Find the sales in terms of total dollars for all

       # DATE_PART('year', occurred_at) year_order,
SUM(total_amt_usd) total_amt_usd
FROM orders
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;

/* 
When we look at the yearly totals, you might notice 
that 2013 and 2017 have much smaller totals than all 
other years. If we look further at the monthly data, 
we see that for 2013 and 2017 there is only one month 
of sales for each of these years (12 for 2013 and 1 
for 2017). Therefore, neither of these are evenly 
represented. Sales have been increasing year over year, 
with 2016 being the largest sales to date. At this rate, 
we might expect 2017 to have the largest sales.

### CASE Statement

/*
The CASE statement always goes in the SELECT clause.

CASE must include the following components: WHEN, THEN, 
and END. ELSE is an optional component to catch cases 
that didn’t meet any of the other previous CASE 
conditions.

CASE WHEN <statement> THEN <value> END

You can make any conditional statement using any 
conditional operator (like WHERE) between WHEN and 
THEN. This includes stringing together multiple 
conditional statements using AND and OR.

You can include multiple WHEN statements, as well as 
an ELSE statement again, to deal with any unaddressed 
conditions.

Note that you should not include an alias when you

because the subquery is treated as an individual value

table.

Also, notice the query here compared a single value. If 
we returned an entire column IN would need to be used 
to perform a logical argument. If we are returning an 
entire table, then we must use an ALIAS for the table, 
and perform additional logic on the entire table.
